A real-time intrusion detection platform that uses deep learning, streaming pipelines, and cloud-native deployment to detect cyber attacks.

Components:

PyTorch model (LSTM/Transformer Autoencoder)

FastAPI inference service

Kafka real-time ingestion

MERN dashboard (React + Node.js)

Terraform for AWS infra

Docker + CI/CD pipeline

Cloud deployment (AWS ECS or Lambda)

What it does:

Detects intrusions from network packets/logs

Classifies normal vs malicious behavior

Shows alerts in a live dashboard

Deploys fully with CI/CD and IaC

Logs everything in a cloud-native backend
